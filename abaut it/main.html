            The Registan was a public square, where people gathered to hear royal proclamations, heralded by blasts on enormous copper pipes called dzharchis - and a place of public executions. It is framed by three madrasahs (Islamic schools) of distinctive Islamic architecture. The square was regarded as the hub of the Timurid Renaissance.</p><br><br><br><br><i class="bi bi-geo-fill"></i><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3wjPnkihwAPeSQSC9">Go there<i class="bi bi-arrow-right-short"></i></a>

It occupies an important place in the history of Central Asian Architecture[2] as the precursor for and had influence on later Great Mughal architecture tombs, including Gardens of Babur in Kabul, Humayun's Tomb in Delhi and the Taj Mahal in Agra, built by Timur's Indian descendants, Turco-Mongols[3] that followed Indian culture with Central Asian influences,[4] Mughals established the ruling Mughal dynasty of the Indian subcontinent.

The name Shah-i-Zinda (meaning "The living king") is connected with the legend that Qutham ibn Abbas, a cousin of the Prophet Muhammad, is buried here. He came to Samarkand with the Arab invasion in the 7th century to preach Islam. Popular legends speak that he was beheaded for his faith but he didn't die, took his head and went into the deep well (Garden of Paradise), where he's still living.

            The Shah-i-Zinda complex was formed over eight (from the 11th until the 19th) centuries and now includes more than twenty buildings.</strong> </p><br><i class="bi bi-geo-fill"></i><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dg3NKXbyVLRPadd27">Go there<i class="bi bi-arrow-right-short"></i></a></div>

        <div class="card"><img src="../img/oksaray.jpg" alt=""><h3>The Oksaray</h3><p><strong>The Aksaray mausoleum is a very interesting place in Samarkand. The literal translation of its name from Turkic is “the white palace”. The mausoleum is more than 1,500 years old. It is located near the Gur-Emir Mausoleum where the remains of Tamerlane and the descendants of the Timurids were buried.
            Unfortunately, tourists often pay no attention to this monument. It is not surprising since this mausoleum looks inconspicuous against the background of the luxurious architectural monuments of Samarkand: brick walls, a dome on a drum that is also made of brick, no bright gloss at all. </strong> </p> <br><br><i class="bi bi-geo-fill"></i><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/C7WANrcZEmbWRQDC7">Go there<i class="bi bi-arrow-right-short"></i></a></div>

            Burhaneddin Sagaradzhi significantly contributed to make Islam widespread among the nomads of Eastern Turkestan. The Islamic scholar, who was married to a Chinese princess, enjoyed great influence at the court of the Yuan dynasty in China. The exact date of his death has not been established, but it is known that he died in China. After the death, according to the Sagaradzhi’s will, his son Abu Said brought his remains to Samarkand.</strong> </p><br><i class="bi bi-geo-fill"></i><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/THDgWB3Ytqofdno88">Go there<i class="bi bi-arrow-right-short"></i></a></div>
